# MLT Stock Image Assistant Installation & 🗂 Folder Mapping
1. Just double click to install the exe installer.
2. Folder locations are flexible. You can set your own paths in the Settings panel.

# 🛠 Dependencies Installation Guide

This guide helps you install **Ollama**, **ComfyUI**, required **custom nodes**, and set up your **folder structure** for the MLT Stock Image Automation Tool. 

[**Windows PowerShell** is used for all the command code installation]

---

## 1. ✅ Ollama Installation

Install Ollama from the official website:

👉 [Download Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)

Steps:
1. Download and install.
2. After installation, run this in PowerShell or terminal:

```bash
ollama run mistral
```

This pulls and prepares the Mistral model used for prompt generation.

---

## 2. 🧰 ComfyUI Installation

You can install ComfyUI anywhere. Here we use your `Documents` folder.

Replace `xxx` with your PC username:

```bash
cd C:\Users\xxx\Documents\
git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI.git
```

Resulting folder structure:
```
C:\Users\xxx\Documents\ComfyUI\
```

---

## 3. 🔌 Install Custom Nodes & Models

### A. 📦 Install ComfyUI Manager (Recommended for Managing Nodes Easily)

Use ComfyUI Manager to install and manage custom nodes without manual Git operations.

1. Open terminal:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\xxx\Documents\ComfyUI\custom_nodes
   git clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager.git
   ```

2. Restart ComfyUI.
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\xxx\Documents\ComfyUI\
   python main.py
   ```
   
3. In the ComfyUI interface (http://127.0.0.1:8188), go to:
   - **Top-right menu → Manager**

---

### B. 🧰 Use ComfyUI Manager to Install These Nodes

After installing the Manager, do the following inside ComfyUI:

#### ➕ WAS Node Suite

1. Go to: **Manager → Custom Nodes**
2. Search: `was-node`
3. Click **Install** next to `WAS Node Suite`

#### 🔼 Real-ESRGAN Upscaler Support

1. Go to: **Manager → Custom Nodes**
2. Search: `RealESRGAN`
3. Click **Install** (you may be prompted to download model weights)

> The node "Upscale by Model" will appear under your image processing node list after installation.

---

### C. SDXL Base & Refiner (EASIEST METHOD ✅)

Instead of manually downloading from HuggingFace:

1. Run ComfyUI:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\xxx\Documents\ComfyUI\
   python main.py
   ```

2. In the ComfyUI UI:
   - Top left menu → **Workflow** → **Browse templates** → **SDXL → SDXL Simple**

3. A popup will appear to **auto-download** the required base + refiner models.
   - You may be prompted to visit HuggingFace to agree to terms.
   - Once you do that, ComfyUI will download:
     - `sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors`
     - `sd_xl_refiner_1.0.safetensors`
   - These are automatically placed in `models/checkpoints/`

✅ **Recommended for beginners.**
