### C. SDXL Base & Refiner 

Instead of manually downloading from HuggingFace:

1. Open PowerShell anywhere, use code below to run ComfyUI:

   - Another alternative path may be:
     - Top left menu → **Workflow** → **Browse templates** → **Image → SDXL Simple**

3. A popup will appear to **auto-download** the required base + refiner models.
   - You may be prompted to visit HuggingFace to agree to terms.
